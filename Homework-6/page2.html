  <p>I'd like to take the time to explain the significance of this
  picture and what my brother means to me.
<br>
<br>
We were in San Francisco with our friend Josh.  Josh showed me some<br>
new camera techniques and I was taking photos of my brother with the bay
in the background.
<br>
<br>
My brother is one of my inspirations to create artwork.  He is always there<br>
encouraging me and giving me constructive feedback.  He also used to coach<br>
me on using Adobe Premiere and I learned a lot from him.
<br>
<br>
I really like this photo that Josh took of me and my brother.  I think<br>
it says a lot.  I edited this in Photoshop to give it a sketch effect and added my logo.
